  "body": "Tell her seriously that you need a moment to talk, plan it for the evening something and tell her while looking her in the eyes that its important, women in general wont hear you until you are being very assertive with them. Yelling at them at the moment or arguing with them never works, they get defensive and it goes in one ear and out the other and she is more concerned with feeling victorious and emotionally satisfied at the moment. Then you explain clearly what it is you are upset about and move from there. \n\nI always try to give people a \"serious moment\" if someone dosent respect you when you are serious they dont care about you as a person. \n\nIm not telling you to give her a second chance, hell, if you feel like breaking up with her now, go for it, i just want you to have a chance to have a serious conversation with her. \n\nIf anything out of principle, to show her \"no i wont brush it off or suck it up when you violate me\"",

  "selftext": "Saw this book at my bookstore job today and was furious when I read the back of it. The premise basically concerns a woman who hunts and kills bad men who's evaded justice and apparently isn't regarded as a serial killer but \"karma\" for bad men. Tell me this book isn't misandrist garbage that promotes not only blatant misandry but also women being violent against men. It appears the so-called \"heroine\" only goes after bad men who've harmed women and doesn't also bother going after bad women who've harmed men. Because hey, it's only men who are ever violent and cruel to women and never the other way around, right?\n\nI'm so sick and tired of this. Men being demonized as violent predators out to harm women, and all the while it's ignored women are also violent to men and boys, and murder them. And misandrists will always have the nerve to deny misandry being real when this is a clear example of how misandry is both real and normalized in society. Imagine the uproar there'd be over a book with a man who hunts down and kills bad women who've evaded justice, which sure as Hell also happens often. But as always, misandrists willfully turn a blind eye to it. The publisher of this book should be boycotted for allowing this misandrist garbage.",
